# Mobile Country Code Converter

Sometimes, like when talking with the CoreTelephony framework, you may want the E.212 country code, but often times, you want the E.164 code instead. CoreTelephony doesn't give you this information, so why not just use the ISO country code CoreTelephony gives you to find the E.164 without hitting a web service? Enter the Mobile Country Code Converter.

## Installation

***Cocoa Pods***

```
$ pod install mcc
```

***Submodule***

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/Greenshire/mcc.git
```

Then drag the `MCCConverter.xcodeproj` file into your workspace, add it as a target dependency of your app target, and finally, add it to your link library build phase. Done.

## Example usage

```
let e164 = MCCConverter.sharedInstance.e164("US") // Returns +1 for the United States.
```

Using 2 digit country codes (or ISO country codes to be more accurate), you can use other values too for all known countries and regions with their own E.164 or E.212 value. For instance, Costa Rica:

```
let e212 = MCCConverter.sharedInstance.e212("CR") // Returns +712
let e164 = MCCConverter.sharedInstance.e164("CR") // Returns +506
```
